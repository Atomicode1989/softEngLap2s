Exercise
Please prepare a program that calculates the roots of the quadratic equation. For the program, please write a set of unit tests that will allow you to check the basic test cases: no real roots, 1 and 2 real roots. Unit tests should be included in a separate project using a selected platform, eg XUnit for C#. Tests should be written in accordance with good practices presented in the lecture and solutions that use various capabilities of the Assert class and operate on different sets of input data (XUnit attribute Theory) will be especially appreciated.
The instruction how to create unit test with VisualStudio Code and .net you can find here:
